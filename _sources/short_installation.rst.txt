Greens Function calculations
----------------------------

To calculate the Greens Functions we rely on modeling codes written by
`Rongjiang Wang <http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/physics-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes/staff/profil/rongjiang-wang/>`__.
If you plan to use the GreensFunction calculation framework,
these codes are required and need to be compiled manually.
The original codes are packaged for windows and can be found 
`here <http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/physics-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes/data-products-services/downloads-software/>`__.

For Unix systems the codes had to be repackaged.

The packages below are also github repositories and you may want to use "git clone" to download:

    git clone <url>

This also enables easy updating for potential future changes.

For configuration and compilation please follow the descriptions provided in each repository respectively.
